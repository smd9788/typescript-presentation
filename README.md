# TypeScript

For this discussion I chose to explore the TypeScript technology. I chose TypeScript
because it is a very common JavaScript "transpiler," and as a JavaScript developer
I thought this would be a useful tool to learn.

## Objectives

-  JavaScript basics
-  Knowledge of code compilers

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-  Describe what TypeScript is and why it is different than JavaScript
-  Identify advantages to using TypeScript over plain JavaScript
-  Write interfaces and classes

# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a JavaScript compiler developed by Microsoft. Per the [TypeScript
doc's](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html), "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles into plain
JavaScript." TypeScript is considered a "transpiler," which is a term
used for a compiler that converts the source code into a language that is structured
similarly and has a similar level of abstraction. That is why TypeScript code will
look almost identical to JavaScript code.

TypeScript is also compatible with almost all JavaScript libraries such as React,
Node, and Angular. It compiles into code compatible with any web browser or any
JavaScript engine (ECMAScript 3 or newer).

# Why use TypeScript?

  - Scalability:
  - ## Error handling:
    - Typescript provides a lot of ways to add validations to your
      JavaScript code, which will throw meaningful error messages without having to
      code out error handling messages that are known to cause performance issues.
